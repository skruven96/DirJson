# DirJson
Json serialization/deseralization header only library in C without any intermediate storage. 

No intermediate storage means that the file is parsed while the data is extracted, so it means 
if a object is read the keys will be read in the order they appear in the file. The same goes for
writing, it will write out the values directly.
